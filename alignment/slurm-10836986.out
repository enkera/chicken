No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)

Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /scratch/groups/wtimp1/170119_chicken/fastq/C6HRUANXX_4_GTGAAA_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	200793	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	20.08
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 200793). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)

SUMMARISING RUN PARAMETERS
==========================
Input filename: /scratch/groups/wtimp1/170119_chicken/fastq/C6HRUANXX_4_GTGAAA_1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.4.2
Cutadapt version: 1.9.1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 2 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 4 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases (e.g. M-bias for BS-Seq applications)
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 2 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 1 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Running FastQC with the following extra arguments: '--path_to_fastqc /home-2/ilee29@jhu.edu/Code/FastQC/fastqc'
Output file(s) will be GZIP compressed

Writing final adapter and quality trimmed output to C6HRUANXX_4_GTGAAA_1_trimmed.fq.gz


  >>> Now performing quality (cutoff 20) and adapter trimming in a single pass for the adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' from file /scratch/groups/wtimp1/170119_chicken/fastq/C6HRUANXX_4_GTGAAA_1.fastq.gz <<<
