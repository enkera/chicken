For fastq QC, scratching everything and just making a python code:
fastqQC.py to output a list of quality scores: read by cycle
fastqQC.R to take the py output and plot the qc plots
Both of the above in Code/ilee/util/
chickenBSseqfastqQC.sh for wrapper

currently I'm working on chicken_fastqQC.R to do everything within R
